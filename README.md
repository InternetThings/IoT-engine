# IoT-Platform
## Purpose
> The Internet of Things platform's main purpose is to enable the use of internet of things devices for monitoring and sharing data. It is built as a privacy first platform, where all your data belongs to you and you decide which pieces of data are available to other people.

## Data structure
> The platform is structured as a distributed network. What this means is that instead of gathering all the data in one big database, we instead prompt the source of the data (usually your local internet of things gateway) to either broadcast a live feed or provide historic data. How your gateway responds is then up to you, and even when connected all data is only readable by you unless you specify otherwise.
